# Image annotation using free drawing.

`annotator` is based on [fabric.js](http://fabricjs.com/), a Javascript HTML5 canvas library and [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/) a package that provides a framework for creating R bindings to JavaScript libraries.

`annotator`  makes it easy to create annotation pipelines in shiny.
