Description: Provides functions to create image annotations through polygon outlining. Annotator has the same function as 'graphics::locator()' but achieves its purpose through drawing, rather than multiple mouse clicks. It is based on the 'htmlwidgets' package and 'fabric.js' JavaScript library <https://fabricjs.com/>.
